Instance metadata is available at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ (the trailing “/” is
required).
• Instance user data is available at: http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data.
• The IP address 169.254.169.254 is a link-local address and is valid only from the instance.
• On Linux you can use the curl command to view metadata and userdata, e.g.
“curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/”.
• The Instance Metadata Query tool allows you to query the instance metadata without having
to type out the full URI or category names.
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2metadata/ec2-metadata
chmod +x ec2-metadata
./ec2-metadata --help
./ec2-metadata -> will return all the metadata (as will --all)
